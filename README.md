# Are-Sequel-Movies-Really-Worse-

2st Year of BSc - A summer vacation project

Try to investigate the sophomore slump in movies. In short, sophomore slump or "sophomore jinx" referes to a case in which the second year or effort fails to achive the high results of the first effort. In this project I will use metrics of rating in IMDb in order to understand if the sequel movies are greater\same\worse than their younger sibilings.
